# Drawing Helper

This is a 3D model viewer designed to act as a drawing reference, to practice drawing faces/heads.
You can change the lighting, and adjust 3 axes (rotation, tilt, yaw).
Includes a Loomis head, a 'planes' head, and a skull.

It's slightly buggy, but I lost interest in drawing so I abandoned this.
